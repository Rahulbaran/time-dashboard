### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

While going through the project,
  * I used `XMLHttpRequest` API to fetch json from `data.json`
  * Practiced the CSS Grid layout.

### Continued development

In the future projects, I will be using more CSS Grid. Also my focus will be on third party APIs based projects.

### Useful Resources

If you ask me about useful resources for web development then first one which I will always recommend is [mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/).
